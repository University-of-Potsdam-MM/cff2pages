About cff2pages
===============

Motivation
----------

The Citation.cff format offers a structured, machine-readable way to store citation metadata.
While it serves machines well, it can be less intuitive for human readers. `cff2pages` bridges this gap by converting Citation.cff files into elegant HTML pages, making citation metadata visually accessible.

Project Description
-------------------

`cff2pages` is a Python package that extracts metadata from a ``Citation.cff`` file and produces a
clean, static HTML page. This can be deployed on GitHub/GitLab Pages, showcasing the project's citation details in a professional format.
